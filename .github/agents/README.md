# Agent Instructions (Legacy Location)

This directory is retained for compatibility with tools that already read `.github/agents/*`.

Canonical, actively maintained instruction files now live at:

- `AI_AGENTS.md` (shared cross-agent playbook)
- `AGENTS.md` (Codex/OpenAI entrypoint)
- `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code entrypoint)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (GitHub Copilot entrypoint)

When adding or updating AI guidance, update those canonical files first.
