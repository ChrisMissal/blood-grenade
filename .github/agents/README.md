# Agent Instructions

This directory contains instructions and guidelines specifically for AI agents and automated tools working with this repository.

## Files

- **copilot-instructions.md**: Comprehensive guidelines for GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants, including:
  - Conventional commit format requirements
  - Pull request guidelines
  - Pre-commit validation system
  - Architecture rules
  - Best practices for AI agents

## Purpose

These instructions help ensure that:
1. AI agents follow the same standards as human contributors
2. Automated suggestions comply with repository requirements
3. Commit messages and code changes are consistent
4. Architecture and quality standards are maintained

## For Human Contributors

If you're a human contributor, please see the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file instead. These agent instructions are optimized for AI assistants and may be more technical and verbose than needed for human readers.

## Usage

AI agents with access to repository documentation will automatically reference these files when making suggestions or generating code. No manual action is required.
