# CLAUDE.md

Claude Code should use the shared repository guidance in `AI_AGENTS.md`.

## Quick Start

1. Read `AI_AGENTS.md`.
2. Keep edits scoped and aligned with existing workspace patterns.
3. Validate with repository scripts before finalizing.

## Required Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run depcruise
npm run commitlint
```

Use conventional commit format for commit and PR titles.
