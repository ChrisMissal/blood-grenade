# AGENTS.md

For Codex and other OpenAI coding agents, follow `AI_AGENTS.md` as the canonical repository playbook.

## Agent Defaults

- Read `AI_AGENTS.md` first.
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for commit/PR policy.
- Run the relevant validation commands before finishing:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run depcruise`
  - `npm run commitlint`

If instructions conflict, prioritize direct task instructions, then CI/workflow constraints, then `AI_AGENTS.md`.
